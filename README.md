classification algorithm (gradient boosting)
The dataset comes from a financial domain
My objective was to predict the probability of a certain financial condition.
This is binary classification problem where i will be predicting he likelihood of default(1) versus non-default(0)
data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation technique was used to maximize the ROC AUC score
